I am taking AEC's intro to analytics engineering to get more technical in the data engineering space. I write a lot of SQL and Python code, but mostly to move data around and summarize it upstream of dashboards and reports. Hoping this course will solidify my understanding of the command line and automating pipelines, give me the skills to set these up without the help of my orgs data engineers, and learn a bit about good data storage and structuring practices.
